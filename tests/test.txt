In today’s era where the world lives in digital information news does not have to be printed on a piece of paper anymore. Now, it can rather be posted on social networking sites, YouTube or twitter and may reach a higher audience. As people tend to have a shorter cognitive load, digital journalism seems to be the right answer, with news now being available 24-hours and can be sent across in different formats such as:  small (1-2 minutes) videos or just simple audio messages gives freedom to the user to access the information when felt relevant, when compared to having to sit near a television at a certain time to hear a certain broadcast.In recent years’ applications such as WordPress, Drupal, Ghost have become very popular as this gives the journalist the freedom to express themselves and these applications allow for personal customization.This method further allows people to interact by leaving comments and share their views rather than having to wait or meet up with people. This also encourages people to talk as its benefit of anonymity (Turauskis, June 2015).
